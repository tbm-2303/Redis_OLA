## What is Redis?

Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory key-value database known for its high performance, simplicity, and versatility. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Redis is often used for caching, session management, real-time analytics, pub/sub messaging, and as a lightweight database. Unlike traditional SQL databases, Redis stores data in memory as key-value pairs instead of using relational tables with rows and columns.

## How Redis Was Installed

Redis was installed using Docker on Windows. The official Redis image was pulled from Docker Hub and used to create isolated Redis containers.

```bash
# Download the official Redis image
docker pull redis
